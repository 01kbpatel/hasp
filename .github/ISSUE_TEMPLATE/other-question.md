## Questions

We only keep bug reports and active requests being worked on in the issues tracker.

For general questions we have opened the [discussion forum](https://github.com/fvanroie/hasp-lvgl/discussions) on github and [#hasp-lvgl channel](https://discord.gg/VCWyuhF) on Discord.

If you are not sure if your question is related to the code development, feel free to ask!
